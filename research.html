      <h2>The Labs Research</h2>
      <p>Our research has several themes. We are mainly focussed on understanding the molecular control of muscle - what controls myofiber behaviour, heterogenity and functional performance? Beyond muscle work, we have interets in fundamental biology with keen focus on the interaction of (epi)genomic events and their role in cell/tissue function and further role (patho)physiology. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Molecular control of single myofiber regulation, heterogeneity and function in healthy tissue</li>
        <li>The route cause and conseuqence of myofiber heterogeneity and diversity</li>
        <li>The role of myofibers in disease pathogenesis - with focus on ALS, SMA, ageing and congenital myopathies</li>
        <li>Understanding the dogma of biology: DNA > RNA > protein in single myoibers</li>
        <li>Interaction epigenetic and genetic marks and their physiological conseqeunce - with focus on ribosomal DNA</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sounds interesting?</h2>
      <p>We are always keen to extend collaborations, and will be happy to discuss poitnetial joint-projects or collabs. If the labs research interests (above) sound of interest or potentially supportive of your work, then please get in touch directly. Further, if you are a keen undergrad, postgrad or fellow and would like to disucss opportunities to join our group, either search the lab webpage for available positions or get in touch directly.
