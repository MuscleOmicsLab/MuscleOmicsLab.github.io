    <h3>Dr. Robert Seaborne</h3>
    <p>Robert completed his PhD (Liverpool John Moores University and Keele Medical
      School) in molecular physiology in 2018, studying the role and dynamics of
      DNA methylation in human and rodent muscle during periods of growth and loss.
      He transitioned to the Rakyan Lab (QMUL, London) to work on understanding the
      consequence of epigenetic/genetic interactions at the ribosomal DNA locus
      before obtaining Lundbeck Foundation funding to pursue a 2-year fellowship
      with Dr. Ochala’s group at the University of Copenhagen. In 2023, he moved
      back to London and established his own research lab at King’s College London.</p>

    <h3>Dr Daniel Vaughan</h3>
    <p>Postdoc in computational muscle biology. Jan 2026 - present. 
      Daniel completed his PhD at the University of Nottingham, jointly between the Schools of Mathematical Sciences and Pharmacy, where he developed continuum mechanics–based models to study how cells respond to fluctuating environments. His research focused on phase-field modelling and high-performance computing to simulate complex cellular dynamics. He also holds a Master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Nottingham. In February 2026, he joined the Seaborne Lab, where he works on the analysis of MuscleOmics data and the development of computational algorithms for its processing. </p>
