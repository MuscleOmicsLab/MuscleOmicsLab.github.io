      <h3>Dr Robert Seaborne</h3>
      <p class="role">Principal Investigator</p>
      <p class="summary">
    Robert completed his molecular physiology PhD in 2018, studying the role and dynamics of DNA methylation in mammalian skeletal muscle, before transitioning into a fucntional genomics postdoc in the Rakyan Lab (QMUL, UK). After ~3 years, he moved to University of Copenhagen on a 2yr Lundbeck Foundation research fellowship, joining Dr. Ochalas lab. In April 2023 he moved back to London to establish his own lab in King's College London.

      <p class="role">Postdoc</p>
      <p>Postdoc in computational muscle biology. Daniel completed his PhD at the University of Nottingham, between the Schools of Mathematical Sciences and Pharmacy, where he developed continuum mechanics–based models to study how cells respond to fluctuating environments. He also holds a Master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Nottingham. In February 2026, he joined the Seaborne Lab, where he works on the analysis of MuscleOmics data and the development of computational algorithms for its processing</p>
