    <p>
      Robert completed his PhD (Liverpool John Moores University and Keele Medical
      School) in molecular physiology in 2018, studying the role and dynamics of
      DNA methylation in human and rodent muscle during periods of growth and loss.
      He transitioned to the Rakyan Lab (QMUL, London) to work on understanding the
      consequence of epigenetic/genetic interactions at the ribosomal DNA locus
      before obtaining Lundbeck Foundation funding to pursue a 2-year fellowship
      with Dr. Ochala’s group at the University of Copenhagen. In 2023, he moved
      back to London and established his own research lab at King’s College London.
