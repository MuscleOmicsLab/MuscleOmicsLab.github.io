  <h1>Welcome to the Seaborne Lab</h1>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"> Our group seeks to understand how and why individual muscle cells (myofibers) behave the way they do. Myofibers are a uniquely specialised cell type, distinguished by their multinucleated architecture, which enables extraordinary plasticity and adaptability across health, development, and disease. We develop and apply cutting-edge muscle-omics and functional approaches to dissect the molecular programmes that govern myofiber regulation, protein function, and cellular behaviour. A central aim of our work is to understand how these finely tuned systems are remodelled by physiological stress and disrupted in disease. Our current research focuses on uncovering the origins of innate myofiber-to-myofiber heterogeneity and diversity, and defining how myofiber regulation becomes dysregulated during ageing, congenital muscle disorders, and neuromuscular diseases, including ALS and SMA.</p>
