  <p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif">Welcome to the Muscle Omics Laboratory website, based at Guys Campus KCL in London (UK). Our research group focusses on developing and applying omic technologies to understand muscle and single muscle cells in healthy and diseased states. This work merges the fields of muscle biology, functional genomics and biophysics and aims to provide us with the most comprehensive and high-resolution understanding of how muscle cells behave and react in various contexts. Our website will hopefully keep you up to date with all our developments from the lab, the outputs we generate, our impact in society and any availability in positions within our group. Disclaimer time, we will try our best to keep things as up-to-date as possible, but the realities of life in research and academia is such that things often pile up! So, if you are very (very) keen on joining the lab and cannot see any positions avilable, get in touch directly.

  <p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif">The Seaborne Lab seeks to understand how and why individual muscle cells (myofibers) behave the way they do. Myofibers are a uniquely specialised cell type, distinguished by their multinucleated architecture, which enables extraordinary plasticity and adaptability across health, development, and disease. We develop and apply cutting-edge muscle-omics and functional approaches to dissect the molecular programmes that govern myofiber regulation, protein function, and cellular behaviour. A central aim of our work is to understand how these finely tuned systems are remodelled by physiological stress and disrupted in disease. Our current research focuses on uncovering the origins of innate myofiber-to-myofiber heterogeneity and diversity, and defining how myofiber regulation becomes dysregulated during ageing, congenital muscle disorders, and neuromuscular diseases, including ALS and SMA. </p>
