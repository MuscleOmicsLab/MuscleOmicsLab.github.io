      <h2>About the Labs work</h2>
      <p>
        The Seaborne <strong>Muscle Omics Laboratory</strong> is based at Guy’s Campus, King’s College London (UK).
        Our research focuses on the development and application of <strong>advanced omics technologies</strong>
        to investigate skeletal muscle biology at both the tissue and single-myofibre level in
        health and disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating <strong>muscle biology</strong>, <strong>functional genomics</strong>, and <strong>biophysics</strong>,
        our work delivers a comprehensive, high-resolution understanding of how muscle cells function,
        adapt, and respond to physiological and pathological stimuli.
      </p>
      <p>
        We actively seek to expand our research horizons through collaboration and are always
        keen to welcome new members to the lab. If you are interested in working with us, or
        exploring shared scientific interests, please get in touch to discuss potential
        opportunities.
